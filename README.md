# Kin ERC20 Token Bridge

This repository contains the source code for the Kin ERC20 Token Bridge, an
open-source implementation for swapping ERC20 tokens for SPL tokens.

**Live at:** https://erc20bridge.github.io/kin/

In order to use the Kin ERC20 Bridge, you will need to connect a fee paying
wallet to fund the SOL transaction fees for the swap. The codebase uses the
standard Solana wallet adapter for the fee paying wallet, so you can use any
wallet that is supported by the Solana wallet adapter. For more information on
Solana transaction fees, you can visit the official Solana documentation at
https://docs.solana.com/transaction_fees.
